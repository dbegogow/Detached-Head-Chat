# frontend

## Project Overview

This is a Vite-based React TypeScript project using Material-UI (MUI) for UI components and theming. The project is containerized using Docker and managed with Docker Compose for easy development and deployment.

---

## Key NPM Packages

- **react** & **react-dom**: Core React libraries for building the UI.
- **@mui/material**: Material-UI core components.
- **@mui/icons-material**: Material Design icons for MUI.
- **@mui/lab**: Experimental and pre-release MUI components.
- **@emotion/react** & **@emotion/styled**: Peer dependencies for MUI, used for styling.
- **@fontsource/roboto**: Roboto font, the default for MUI.
- **typescript**: TypeScript support.
- **vite**: Fast build tool and dev server.
- **eslint** and related plugins: Linting and code quality tools.

---

## Docker & Docker Compose Setup

- **Dockerfile** (in `frontend/`):
  - Uses `node:alpine` as the base image.
  - Sets `/app` as the working directory.
  - Installs dependencies and runs the dev server.

- **docker-compose.yml** (in project root):
  - Defines a `frontend` service.
  - Builds from the `frontend` directory.
  - Mounts the frontend code and node_modules for live development.
  - Exposes port `5173` (default for Vite).
  - Sets `VITE_HOST=0.0.0.0` for proper networking.
  - Runs `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0` to start the Vite dev server.

### Common Docker Commands

- **Rebuild and start in detached mode:**
  ```sh
  docker-compose up --build -d
  ```

- **Stop and remove containers:**
  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **View logs:**
  ```sh
  docker-compose logs frontend
  ```

- **Check running containers:**
  ```sh
  docker-compose ps
  ```

## Notes

- When adding new npm packages, run `npm install <package>` in the `frontend` directory, then rebuild the container.
- The project uses the Roboto font and MUI’s theme provider by default.
- Old CSS files have been removed in favor of MUI’s styling system.
